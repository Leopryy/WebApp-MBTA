Project Writeup
    For this project, I make a website that takes the input of a location name and returns the nearest station and if it is wheelchair accessible. To fulfill the function, I utilized two APIs to obtain
    the information that is needed for the information. First, I used an API to get the Latitude and 
    Longitude of the location. Then, using the second API and the information of the Latitude and Longitude from the first API to get the information about the nearest station and if it is wheelchair accessible. Moreover, I also wrote the code for the layout of the input and output website and the code that I need to get the website to run. 

Project Reflection
    The whole process went pretty smoothly since we have done a similar project in class. The issue that I have met during this project is that I cannot obtain the information about the station when I was writing the code for the second API. However, this issue turned out that is because there is no station near the location I entered.

    The other issue I experienced is that when I was trying to run the website, there was nothing showing up. It was because I forgot to save the code I wrote for the layout of the website page. Later on, I also experience an error for the output page, because I have entered the wrong Html document name for output. 

    In all the whole project did not have too many problems. The issues that appeared were due to some mistake that I made.
